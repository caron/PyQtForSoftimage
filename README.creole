== Installation:
This is for users who are just installing the provided addon. These instructions describe how to use the plugin with system installed version of Python. All requirements needed to use system Python inside Softimage must be met first. These instructions are listed below...

# Install [[https://www.python.org/downloads/|Python]]. This plugin was tested with version 2.7.x but can work with older versions.
# Install [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20217/|pywin32 217]].
# Install [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyqt/files/PyQt4/|PyQt]].
# In Softimage, uncheck "Use Python Installed with Softimage (Windows Only)" from Preferences/Scripting.
# Install [[http://www.steven-caron.com/downloads/tools/PyQtForSoftimage_beta6.xsiaddon|PyQtForSoftimage]] addon.
# Run example scripts...

If you want to use native Python installed with Softimage, you must install PyQt4 into a location which Softimage can import from. Either you install PyQt4 directly into Softimage's Python install "Softimage Version\Application\python\Lib\site-packages" or make sure you put the PyQt4 installation directory on the [[http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html#the-module-search-path|module search path]].
   
== Build Instructions:
**These instructions are not complete yet!**

This section is only for users wishing to customize PyQtForSoftimage.

PyQtForSoftimage has been developed under Windows, support for Linux is untested.

PyQtForSoftimage has been built and tested with the following dependencies...

*CMake 3.1.3   http://www.cmake.org/download/
*Qt 4.8.5      http://download.qt.io/archive/qt/
*PyQt 4.10.3    http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download
*PySide 1.2.2  https://download.qt.io/official_releases/pyside
*Python 2.7.9  https://www.python.org/downloads/

Compling Qt from source can be quite an involved process, its advised to obtain
the precompiled binaries.

Once you have installed all the dependencies get the source code either by
downloading the source archive directly from github or obtaining a distributed
version control system like git or mecurial (with hg-git plugin). Information on
setting up git is available from http://help.github.com/.

Now you can run CMake on the source directory and it will generate the necessary
project files for compiling.

At this time you will need to move the plugin files to a plugin/addon directory
by hand. Copy QtSoftimage.dll, qtevents.py, sisignals.py, pyqt_example.py and the Qt module directory to a plugins directory and Restart Softimage.

== PySide support
PySide support is availble now. The Qt module which is now in the source tree handles the switch between PyQt or PySide. You should call Qt.initialize() at the top of your files... it currently favors PySide over PyQt so if you have both installed but want to use one or the other you can pass in "PySide" or "PyQt4".

{{{
   # favors PySide
   import Qt
   Qt.initialize()
}}}

{{{
   # forces PyQt4
   import Qt
   Qt.initialize("PyQt4")
}}}
